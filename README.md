This was my first practise (paired programming) in a lab with writing functions to pass tests. This lab covered running tests, reading the given error message, then amending the code to pass the tests. 

In summary:

<p> Practice creating functions </p>
<p> Practice creating objects, assigning variables, calling functions </p>
<p> Practice testing, writing expectation then solution. </p>
